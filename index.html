  <h2 class="section-heading">A Brief Biography of a Humble Philanthropist.</h2>

  <section class="biography">
    <div class="biography-picture">
      <img src="assets/logo.jpeg" alt="Sri S.C. Trivedi">
    </div>
    <div class="biography-content">
      <h3>Sri Shiv Chandra Trivedi (Nov 1940 - Jan 2007)</h3>
      <p><strong>Sri S.C. Trivedi</strong> was born into a joint family of Jamindar Sri Prabhu Dayal Trivedi, who resided in a small village named Dhanni Nevada in Kanpur Dehat. His grandfather, Shri Prabhu Dayal, had three sons, and his father, Shri Brij Mohan Trivedi, was the eldest son, who took up all the responsibilities after his fatherâ€™s death.</p>
      <p>His mother, Smt. Raj Laxmi Devi, was a kind-hearted and loving woman, the only daughter of a famous Vaidyaraj of Kanpur. She inspired Sri Shiv Chandra Trivedi with her good qualities.</p>
      
      <h3>Early Life and Education</h3>
      <p>Being a member of a joint family, Sri Trivedi had to struggle during his adolescence. He could not pay attention to his studies due to the responsibilities of the joint family. However, he excelled in education, always achieving first division. He completed his Intermediate from BNSD College, Kanpur, and BSc from SD College, Kanpur. He later joined BSND College and became an all-India level competition winner in engineering. He completed his BESc Degree with Distinction and fulfilled his dream of becoming an engineer.</p>
      
      <h3>Career and Contributions</h3>
      <p>Sri Trivedi's career started with the Uttar Pradesh State Roadways Transport Corporation, where he worked from 1972 to 2000 in various capacities, rising to the level of Manager. He worked in multiple places, including Kanpur, Etawah, Lucknow, Faizabad, Moradabad, and Azamgarh. He managed and earned handsome profits for the organization.</p>
      <p>Post-2006, he was involved in various welfare activities and established UPKAR, an institution working for welfare society.</p>
      
      <h3>Philanthropic Activities</h3>
      <p>In memory of Sri S.C. Trivedi, his wife, Dr. Shashi Trivedi, has continued his legacy with various social services:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Gold Medal for Best Post-graduate Student:</strong> Awarded to the best post-graduate student of Kalicharan Degree College for 2008-2009.</li>
        <li><strong>Award for Economically Weak Students:</strong> Provided to the employees of Nainital Public Inter College.</li>
        <li><strong>Hospital Construction:</strong> In 2008-2009, a 30-bedded hospital was built in Aastha, especially for economically weak sections.</li>
        <li><strong>Educational Support:</strong> Distribution of 500 sweaters to students of various schools.</li>
        <li><strong>Financial Assistance:</strong> In 2009-2010, financial assistance was given to a student selected for the Engineering Course, amounting to Rs. 51,000.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Legacy</h3>
      <p>Sri Trivedi was very attached to his mother, who inspired him to pursue social causes. He established a school in 1991, which later became an Intermediate College recognized by the UP Board. He dreamed of establishing a hospital, and his dream was realized in 1995. Now, in the same building, a mother and child care hospital is being established in his memory.</p>
